Hello!

Please enter the following information.  First, change "Name" to "My name"
below.  Then provide your name and class year, which must be on the same lines
as "My name" and "Class year," respectively.  Then answer the qeustion about
prior programming experience on a line following the question, leaving a blank
line between the question and your answer.  Finally, delete the "Something
interesting" block of text and replace it with your response.

If you are using Vim, the following keys in command mode might be helpful:

* 'i' puts you in insert mode, letting you insert text just before the
  cursor position.
* 'a' puts you in insert mode, letting you insert text just after the
  cursor position.
* 'o' creates a new line below the line where the cursor is and enters
  insert mode.
* 'x' deletes the character under the cursor.

Name:
Class year:

Do you have any prior programming experience?  If so, what?

Something interesting you would like to tell me.  This can be about
you, about something you find interesting, whatever!
