Hello!

Please enter the following information.  First, change "Name" to "My name"
below.  Then provide your name and class year, which must be on the same lines
as "My name" and "Class year," respectively.  Then answer the qeustion about
prior programming experience on a line following the question, leaving a blank
line between the question and your answer.  Finally, delete the "Something
interesting" block of text and replace it with your response.

If you are using Vim, the following keys in command mode might be helpful:

* 'i' puts you in insert mode, letting you insert text just before the
  cursor position.
* 'a' puts you in insert mode, letting you insert text just after the
  cursor position.
* 'o' creates a new line below the line where the cursor is and enters
  insert mode.
* 'x' deletes the character under the cursor.

My Name:  Norman Danner
Class year:  1991

Do you have any prior programming experience?  If so, what?

Yes, I have been programming since about 1985.  I have experience programming
in Fortran, C, C++, Java, Python, and SML.

Italian honey bees have stings that are much less painful than those of
American honey bees.
